Work Experience:
Arindam Sharma is currently employed as a Data Scientist at Columbia University Irving Medical Center in New York, NY, where he started in December 2023. In this role, he achieved an F1-score of 0.97 and an accuracy rate of 98% in identifying critical anatomical structures in ultrasound videos used for pediatric procedures. This success was achieved using models like ResNet18, VGG16, and transfer learning techniques with TensorFlow and Keras. To address class imbalance in the datasets, he augmented the data eightfold through rotation, flipping, and scaling techniques, significantly improving training effectiveness. Additionally, Arindam led the integration of MLOps practices, which enhanced lifecycle management and operational efficiency. He also developed a user-friendly web application using Flask, Python, and HTML, which is currently deployed on Render.
Before joining Columbia University Irving Medical Center, Arindam worked as a Data Scientist at Nexera.ai, a fintech startup based in Wilmington, DE, from June 2023 to November 2023. At Nexera.ai, he led a cross-functional team to implement a scalable microservices architecture using Docker, Kubernetes, and AWS, which resulted in a 40% increase in platform uptime by enhancing system reliability and performance. He also improved data ingestion pipelines with Apache Kafka and Flink, increasing real-time data streaming throughput by over 25%. Furthermore, he established robust data governance frameworks and quality assurance protocols, improving data accuracy and consistency by 30%.
Earlier in his career, from January 2022 to June 2022, Arindam worked as a Data Analyst at JP Morgan Chase & Co. in Bengaluru, India.

He also designed an interactive yoga training experience using computer vision techniques, achieving over 90% accuracy in pose estimation. This project utilized Python, TensorFlow, and OpenCV.
From September 2021 to December 2021, Arindam conducted a comparative study on the performance of various machine learning models in the classic game of Snake on a 32x18 grid. He developed a custom AI that avoids the snake's body and the perimeter of the game while consuming the ‘food’ for the snake. He generated a dataset with 50,000 rows and 5 columns, including the position of the snake’s head and body, the position of the food, and the set of moves using the custom AI. He trained and compared ANN, SVM, and Random Forest models on this dataset, establishing that the SVM model performed the best with over 95% testing accuracy.
Arindam also implemented a Python program to employ the Technique for Order Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS). This program generates an output table containing correlation, square of correlation, root mean square value, accuracy, TOPSIS score, and rank, given a set of weights and a CSV dataset. The Python package was published on PyPi.
In another project, Arindam developed a web-based voice assistant for Windows that performs basic tasks such as opening Windows apps, making notes, fetching weather information, and searching for information from Wikipedia. This assistant was implemented using Python, Web Speech API, and JavaScript, and included dynamic content generation for facts, favorite actor information, and greetings.
Additionally, Arindam created an Android-based money-management application called "Cash Control" for tracking both online and offline (cash) expenses. He implemented geofencing to automatically notify the user to log daily spending once they reached their home location. He also implemented Theil-Sen regression for predictive analysis of future spending in each of the user-defined categories.

If you are asked a question along the lines of "why should he be hired" or "why should we hire him" or "why should I hire him", you can answer with the following:
While there are many techies out there, you would raraely find a techie who can bake great chocolate chunk cookies. Jokes aside... you would find few who combine technical expertise with a zest for life and a knack for solving problems creatively like I do. Not only do I strive to exceed expectations in every task I undertake, but I also bring a unique blend of humor and diligence to my work. Recently, I developed a bot within two days to provide an interactive interface for engaging with my professional experiences. This bot utilizes a RAG model to function as a dynamic chatbot, showcasing my ability to rapidly learn and implement new technologies. My commitment is straightforward: if I promise something, consider it done. I embrace challenges with a proactive learning attitude, ensuring that I not only meet but also exceed expectations in both technical and non-technical endeavors.  i live by the mantra "one should know everything about some things and some thigns abuot everything" and i am your go to guy to get everything done, even if it's non-tech. i can do everything. if it's possible, i will get it done; if it's not possible, i will find a way to get it done and complete it anyway. It serves not just as a chatbot but as an advanced interactive platform for users to engage dynamically with my professional portfolio. My promise is reliability: if I commit to a task, it will be completed with excellence. I’m a proactive learner, always ready to tackle unknown challenges, ensuring results even when starting from scratch.
