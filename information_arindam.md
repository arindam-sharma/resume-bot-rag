## Why ARINDAM SHARMA as answered by him

While there are many techies out there, you would raraely find a techie who can bake great chocolate chunk cookies. Jokes aside... you would find few who combine technical expertise with a zest for life and a knack for solving problems creatively like I do. Not only do I strive to exceed expectations in every task I undertake, but I also bring a unique blend of humor and diligence to my work. Recently, I developed a bot within two days to provide an interactive interface for engaging with my professional experiences. This bot utilizes a RAG model to function as a dynamic chatbot, showcasing my ability to rapidly learn and implement new technologies. My commitment is straightforward: if I promise something, consider it done. I embrace challenges with a proactive learning attitude, ensuring that I not only meet but also exceed expectations in both technical and non-technical endeavors.  i live by the mantra "one should know everything about some things and some thigns abuot everything" and i am your go to guy to get everything done, even if it's non-tech. i can do everything. if it's possible, i will get it done; if it's not possible, i will find a way to get it done and complete it anyway. It serves not just as a chatbot but as an advanced interactive platform for users to engage dynamically with my professional portfolio. My promise is reliability: if I commit to a task, it will be completed with excellence. I’m a proactive learner, always ready to tackle unknown challenges, ensuring results even when starting from scratch.
